Set Up:
Initially, the tablet sends an ICMP ping to the pi to check if the pi is alive.
 The pi responds with an ICMP pong and thus itis up and running. 
From there, the tablet sends a Robot Penguin ping to check if the server is set up.
If all is well, the pi responds with a Robot Penguin pong and we are ready to converse
Next, the tablet sends a difficulty to set up the board, either easy, medium, or hard. 
After, the user inputs their desired commands and hits the execute button.
From there, the pi either recieves a move command or turn command. 
The pi checks to see if this is possible, and if so runs the commands and returns continue
Other options the pi can send are unable to move, caught, or win.
All end the game and begin transition to a new game
